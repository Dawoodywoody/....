Dragon Wyrmling
Most true dragons can live for thousands of years, but every
single one of them starts life out as a wyrmling. Even though
wyrmlings are smaller and weaker than that of an adult,
these little dragons are still a formidable force and will only
become stronger as they age.
The average dragon remains a wyrmling anywhere from
ten years to a number of decades. During this time they tend
to hunt large animals and sometimes even people, as a
wyrmling can stand as tall as 5 feet at their shoulder
depending on the species. While they lack the frightful
presence of an adult, a wyrmling has most other features of
their adult forms, but merely weaker due to their young age.

mending spell or by consuming souls within it. For each
casting of mending or each soul consumed, your phylactery

you drop to 0 hit points on a different plane than your
phylactery, you immediately die and your soul passes

it. Your phylactery is now immune to nonmagical
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and has
resistance to all other damage types.

to your Charisma modifier. For each soul consumed this way
you regain a number of hit points equal 1d6 + your Charisma
modifier.

Force of Undead Nature
At 14th level the inherent magic within your form
strengthens. The last of your flesh falls free, leaving only a
draconic skeleton with bits of skin and scale clinging to your
form. When you are forced to make a saving throw, you can
consume a number of souls up to your Charisma modifier
provided your phylactery is on your person. When you do, you
gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to the number of souls
consumed.

arcane might of dragons. You use your Charisma whenever a
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC
for a dragon mage spell you cast and when making an attack
roll with one.
Spell Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +

your Charisma modifier

Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5 of the
Player's Handbook) as a spellcasting focus for your dragon
mage spells.

Spellscale
Beginning when you take this archetype at 1st level, the spells
you cast ripple over your scales creating a protective barrier.
Whenever you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher you can use
your reaction to channel the excess energy to harden your
scales. When you do, you gain a bonus to your AC equal to
half the level of the spell (minimum 1) which lasts until the
start of your next turn.
If you cast another spell while your AC is increased in this
manner, you choose which of the spells grants the bonus.
Spellbound Exhalation
At 6th level, your ability to cast spells has extended to your
breath weapon. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st-level or
higher that has an area, you can change the range and shape
to that of your breath weapon. The area of the original spell
must create a cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere and cannot
have a range of self in order for you to change it to that of
your breath weapon.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus and regain all uses when you finish a long
rest.

Mystic Wrath
At 10th, the magic that infuses you makes you more powerful.
You add your Charisma modifier to your Dragon's Wrath DC.
Helix Arcanum
At 14th level, your magic feeds into itself, empowering your
abilities. You gain a bonus to the Spell Attack Rolls and Spell
Save DC's of your spells equal to the number of Draconic
Traits you have that have dragon mage as a prerequisite.

Hidecarved Ancestry
Hidecarved dragons are members of an enigmatic order of
dragons and half-dragons. Their name comes from the
markings engraved on their scales, which grant them
incredible mystical protection. Dragons of the hidecarved
order resemble monks in their strict discipline, dedication to
personal perfection, and mystical transcendence.

Hidecarved Ancestry Features
Dragon Level Feature
1st Mystical Protection, Suppress Weakness
6th Empowered Protection
10th Advanced Etchings
14th Additional Etchings
Mystical Protection
Beginning at 1st level when you take this archetype, the
magic imbued in your tattoos grants you a variety of boons
that you can channel. As an action you can activate one of
these boons.
Mystical Armoring. Your AC increases by 2.
Spell Resistance. You have advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.
Timeless Health. You are immune to poison damage, the
poisoned condition, and all diseases.
Your boon lasts for 1 minute unless the boon grants you a
spell with a specific duration. You can activate a number of
boons equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all uses
when you finish a long rest. If you activate a boon while one is
already active, the effects of the first boon end.
Suppress Weakness
Also at 1st level, the magic of your sigils dampens the pain of
blows that strike you. You can use your reaction to being hit
with a critical hit, turning it into a normal hit.
Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until
you finish a short rest or long rest.
Empowered Protection
Starting at 6th level, the magic within your markings has
become more powerful. You can activate boons as a bonus
action.
Advanced Etchings
At 10th level, the markings bestow upon your scales
additional power. You can choose from the following boons
when activating your Mystical Protection.
Shifty Scales. When you activate this boon, you cast the
blur spell.
Inscrutability. The dragon is immune to any effect that
would sense its emotions or read its thoughts. Wisdom
(Insight) checks made to ascertain its intentions or sincerity
have disadvantage.
Undying. When you activate this boon, you cast the death
ward spell on yourself.
Additional Etchings
At 14th level, you can activate two boons at once. If the boon
you choose casts a spell that requires concentration, you
cannot choose another boon that requires concentration.

Shadow Dragon Ancestry
Shadow dragons are true dragons that were either born in
the Shadowfell or transformed by years spent within its
dismal confines. Some shadow dragons embrace the
Shadowfell for its bleak landscapes and desolation. Others
seek to return to the Material Plane, hungry to spread the
darkness and evil of the Plane of Shadow.
Shadow Dragon Ancestry Features
Dragon Level Feature
1st Bathed in Darkness, Shadow Stealth
6th Shadow Breath
10th Umbral Striker
14th Living Shadow
Bathed in Darkness
Beginning at 1st level when you take this archetype, you are
suffused with the dark energy of the Shadowfell, granting you
several benefits listed below.
You gain resistance to necrotic damage if you are not
already.
Any elemental damage you deal, such as that of your
breath weapon, changes to necrotic.
Your darkvision increases to 120 feet.
You gain the Enhanced Senses Draconic Trait if you don't
already have it. This trait does not count against the
number of traits you know.
Shadow Stealth
Also at 1st level, your ability to blend into the night is
enhanced by your shadow magic. You gain proficiency in the
Stealth skill if you don't have it already. Your proficiency
bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses
that proficiency.
Additionally, while in dim light or darkness, you can take
the Hide action as a bonus action.

Shadow Breath
At 6th level, your breath is infused with the necromantic
energies of the Shadowfell. Whenever a Humanoid creature
is reduced to 0 hit points by your breath weapon it
immediately dies and you can use your reaction to raise an
undead Corpse Shadow (found in Shadowheart Apocrypha:
Classes pg. 61) from its body under your control. You can
create and control a number of Shadows this way equal to
half your proficiency bonus rounded down (minimum 1). The
Shadows share your initiative and takes their turns right after
yours.
On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to
mentally command any of your Shadows as long as they are
within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple Shadows, you
can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the
same command to each one). You decide what action the
Shadows will take and where they will move during their
next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to
guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no
commands, the Shadows only defend themselves against
hostile creatures. Once given an order, the Shadows continue
to follow it until its task is complete.
The Shadows are under your control for 1 hour, after
which they dissipates into nothingness. You can use this
feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus,
and you regain all uses when you finish a long rest.
Umbral Striker
At 10th level, despite your size and presence, you are
practically unnoticeable when hidden. While you are hidden
and miss with an attack using one of your natural weapons,
the attack doesn't reveal your location.
Living Shadow
At 14th level, you are just as much a shadow on the wall as a
creature in the world. While in dim light or darkness, you
have resistance to all damage that isn't force, psychic, or
radiant.

Song Dragon Ancestry
Song dragons are a peculiar sort, known for their melodic
magics and shapeshifting abilities. Often referred to as
'weredragons,' these wyrms have the rare ability to craft a
beautiful human guise that is a step above even the most
talented shape shifting dragons.
Song Dragon Ancestry Features
Dragon Level Feature
1st Spellcasting, Weredragon
6th Masque of Melody
10th Siren Song
14th Draconic Melody
Spellcasting
Beginning when you take this archetype at 1st level, your very
nature is of music and magic. See chapter 10 of the Player's
Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting.
Spell Points
A song dragon's magic comes from within their being, and as
such, they pull from a pool of magical energy represented as
spell points. Each spell has a point cost based on its level,
represented in the table below. In order to cast a spell, you
must deduct the number of points from the total number of
spell points you have available. Cantrips do not cost any
points. If you have less points than a spell's given point cost,
you cannot cast it, and your spell points can't reach below 0.
Spell Point Cost
Spell Level Point Cost
Cantrips 0
1st 2
2nd 3
3rd 5
4th 6
5th 7
The number of spell points you have per level is shown in the
spell points column of the Song Dragon Spells table, and the
level of spell you can cast with those points is show in the
Max Spell Level column of the same table. You regain all
spent spell points when you finish a long rest.
Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard
spell list. The Spells Known column of the Song Dragon
Spells table shows when you learn more bard spells of your
choice. Each of these spells must not be of a higher level than
your max spell level. For instance, when you reach 5th level in
this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
choose one of the song dragon spells you know and replace it
with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must
not be of a higher level than your max spell level.

Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your dragon mage
spells, since the power of your magic comes from the great
arcane might of dragons. You use your Charisma whenever a
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC
for a dragon mage spell you cast and when making an attack
roll with one.
Spell Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +

your Charisma modifier

Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5 of the
Player's Handbook) as a spellcasting focus for your dragon
mage spells.

Weredragon
Also at 1st level, you have gained the unique ability to change
into a human form, retaining your melodic power. You gain
proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't have it
already. You also gain the Shape Changer trait. This trait
does not count against the number of traits you know. When
you transform using this trait, you always take the form of a
supernaturally beautiful human.
Masque of Melody
Starting at 6th level, you are able to mask your spellcasting
with your natural talent. Whenever you cast a spell while in
your human form, you can roll a Performance check against
your Dragon's Wrath DC. On a success, creatures affected by
the spell are unaware it was you that cast it. This includes
spells where the target automatically knows you are the
source, such as friends or charm person.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus and you regain all uses when you finish a
long rest.
Siren Song
At 10th level, your human guise is so convincing that not even
the arcane can pierce it. You gain the Dragon's Immutability
trait if you don't already have it, or a draconic trait of your
choice. This trait does not count against the number of traits
you know, and you must meet all the prerequisites for the
trait. While in your human form, you are perceived as truly
being human to those with truesight or other abilities that
can see the true form of shapeshifted creatures.
Draconic Melody
At 14th level, your beauty is unparalleled even in your natural
form. You can use your Masque of Meldoy feature even when
in your natural draconic form.
Additionally, when you make a Charisma (Performance)
check, your proficiency bonus is doubled for the roll.

Species vs. Archetype
From a traditional 'lore' perspective, song dragons
as a class make little sense since they are a unique
species of dragon. However from a 5th edition
mechanics stand point it is rather hard make a
song dragon race work without it being vastly
overpowered.
If you would like to make a 'true to form' song
dragon, do the following: Choose copper dragon as
your subrace and asthetically recolor your scales to
a bluish silver. Keep your subrace traits, but change
your breath weapon and damage resistance to
lightning damage.

19

Voidmaw Ancestry
The Great Maw is a cosmic draconic entity of alien nature
and immense power, capable of altering the fabric of space
itself in order to consume all that it desires. Cults of dragons
over the millennia have referred to it as the Dragon God of
Consumption, while others believe it to be a corrupting
influence that ensures the downfall of all that is dragonkind.
Dragons gifted with the powers of the Great Maw are
exceedingly rare and powerful, able to tear holes in space for
countless teeth to grab and consume any who oppose them.
Once a voidmaw has set its sight on something it desires, it is
near impossible to sway it towards any other goal. At their
best, a voidmaw is a force that will ensure a goal is met no
matter the cost. At their worst, a voidmaw is an engine of
destruction devouring all in their path.
Voidmaw Ancestry Features
Dragon Level Feature
1st Ravenous Waltz, Covetous Nature
6th Hungering Jaws
10th Ravenous Bloom
14th Voracious Appetite
Ravenous Waltz
Beginning at 1st level when you take this archetype, you can
use your draconic power to tear a hole in the veil and allow
the a portion of the Great Maw's power to spill forth. You can
expend a use of your Breath Weapon to change it from an
elemental force to a mass of hungering teeth. Each creature
in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your
Dragon's Wrath DC. On a failed save a creature takes magical
piercing damage equal to your Breath Weapon damage, half
as much damage on a successful save.
Covetous Nature
Also at 1st level, the power of the Great Maw greedily hoards
your life force. You are immune to having your hit points
drained in order to restore those of hostile creatures, such as
with the vampiric touch spell or a vampire's bite attack.
Hungering Jaws
At 6th level you can tear the fabric of space to summon the
jaws of the Great Maw. As an action you can have the jaws
clamp down on a creature of your choice within 30 feet of
you. That creature makes a Strength saving throw against
your Dragon's Wrath DC. On a failed save, the target takes
damage equal to your breath weapon damage, half as much
on a successful save. A target that fails the save is restrained
by the jaws until the end of your next turn.
Once you've used this feature you can't do so again until
you finish a short or long rest.
